# KivyCythonisMissing
While trying to install kivy for 3.6 version of python we encounture
//We miss have C extensions so thats why we see that mistake
So I found that solution while  trying to sort it out ;

1- Go to website below
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Cython/

2- Downloads â†“ the Cython 0.25.2

The Cython compiler for writing C extensions for the Python language.

The Cython language is a superset of the Python language (almost all Python code is also valid Cython code), but Cython additionally supports optional static typing to natively call C functions, operate with C++ classes and declare fast C types on variables and class attributes. This allows the compiler to generate very efficient C code from Cython code.

This makes Cython the ideal language for writing glue code for external C/C++ libraries, and for fast C modules that speed up the execution of Python code.

Note that for one-time builds, e.g. for CI/testing, on platforms that are not covered by one of the wheel packages provided on PyPI, it is substantially faster than a full source build to install an uncompiled (slower) version of Cython with:

pip install Cython --install-option="--no-cython-compile"
